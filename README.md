## Description

Live URL üëáüèº<br>

My motivation was simply to solidify my understanding of Jquery and to practice my Javascript. I build this project to also practice using dayjs. I want to fully understand everything that I am coding. I learned that in order to be good at jquery, you must have a solid understanding of Javascript.

## Usage

To start the Day Planner will look like this. Depending on the current time of day, the time blocks may vary in color. In the image below, the current time was 2:39PM. This shows the time blocks prior are grayed out as they are in the past. The current 2PM time block is red as it is the current hour and every hour after is green as its in the future. The planner only shows 9AM to 5PM business hours.<br>

<br>
In each empty space to the right of the time is a text area where you can important appointments/important info.<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="text unputted in text area in 3PM time block" src="./images/typeevent.png"><br>
<br>
The save button on the right will save what you inputted in the text area to local storage.<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="shows value saved in local storage" src="./images/saveslocalstorage.png"><br>
<br>
The day planner is set to reload the page every minute to keep the time at the top of the page current. It also shows todays date & day of the week. Once the page reloads, anything saved in the text area will stay as the javascript includes an iteration for each time block to get the values from local storage if there is any.<br>
